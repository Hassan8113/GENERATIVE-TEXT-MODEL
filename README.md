# 🧠 Text Generation Model using GPT-2

## 🔍 Project Description

This project demonstrates a basic *text generation system* built using the *GPT-2 model* from the Hugging Face transformers library. The goal was to create a generative text model that can produce *coherent paragraphs* based on user-provided topics or starting sentences.

The model runs entirely *offline*, making it ideal for simple experiments without needing any API keys or external accounts.
